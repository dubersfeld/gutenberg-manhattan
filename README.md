# gutenberg-manhattan
I present here a microservice-oriented application that uses some basic Docker features including docker-compose. It consists of a collection of separate servers all running in Docker containers. MongoDB is used for persistence and also runs in a container. Moreover all backend servers use reactive connection to MongoDB and Spring WebFlux rather than Spring RESTful. All backend servers are tested using JUnit5 test classes.
